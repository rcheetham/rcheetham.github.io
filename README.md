## Robert Cheetham
I am an independent consultant specializing in remote sensing and geospatial technology. For 23 years I was the founder and CEO of [Azavea](https://github.com/azavea), a B Corporation that created geospatial software and data analytics with a public service mission.  Azavea developed and contributed to many open source geospatial projects, including [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io/), [Raster Vision](https://rastervision.io/), [DistrictBuilder](https://github.com/PublicMapping/districtbuilder), [OpenTreeMap](https://github.com/OpenTreeMap), [Raster Foundry](https://github.com/raster-foundry), [Loam](https://github.com/azavea/loam), [Franklin](https://github.com/azavea/franklin), [Granary](https://github.com/raster-foundry/granary), [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/), and [Model My Watershed](https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed).

I sold Azavea in 2023 to Element 84 where I served as the Chief Strategy Officer during 2023. Prior to founding Azavea, I was a software developer and GIS analyst for the University of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Police Department. Before that I was a civil servant in Japan.

- Coaching and learning Crossfit

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Python in the context of geospatial work
- Japanese
- Thailand and Burma history, particularly related to WWII

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Tips and introductions to folks that do work related to space, remote sensing, and geospatial technology industries in Japan
- Introductions to folks doing geography and history research related to the border of Thailand and Burma

### 💬 Ask me about 
- Geospatial technology
- Remote sensing and Earth observation
- Open geospatial data
- Geospatial open source software
